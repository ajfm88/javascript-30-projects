# Norman The Necromancer

To get a development environment running:

- Install node
- Run `npm install` in the project directory
- Run `npm run dev` to run locally

If you want to deploy a version of the game:

- Run `npm build` to create a build
- Now deploy the contents of the `dist` dir to a static site host (e.g. Netlify/GitHub pages).
